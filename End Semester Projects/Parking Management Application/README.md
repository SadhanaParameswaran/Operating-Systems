Implement a parking management application. This should have functions which will simulate the arrival of vehicles to the parking lot (arrival()) and departure of vehicles from the parking lot (departure()). These functions should run on separate processes. The application should define the total parking lots in the parking place and make sure that vehicles are allowed only when there is free parking lot is available. Similarly, the application should not allow the departure function to if no vehicles are there in the parking place.
