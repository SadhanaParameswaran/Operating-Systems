First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.
Characteristics of FCFS method
  •	It supports non-pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.
  •	Jobs are always executed on a first come, first-serve basis.
  •	It is easy to implement and use.
  •	This method is poor in performance, and the general wait time is quite high.

Example of FCFS scheduling
A real-life example of the FCFS method is buying a movie ticket on the ticket counter. In this scheduling algorithm, a person is served according to the queue manner. The person who arrives first in the queue first buys the ticket and then the next one. This will continue until the last person in the queue purchases the ticket. Using this algorithm, the CPU process works in a similar manner.

Conclusion
While FCFS is the simplest form of a CPU scheduling algorithm & easy to implement, it also has high Average wait time and is not ideal for time sharing system as short processes that arrival late will have a long waiting time which makes FCFS not very efficient.
